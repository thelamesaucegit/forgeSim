"The Reanimator" is a Dimir (Blue/Black) AI that focuses on filling its graveyard with powerful creatures and then reanimating them for massive value. It's a mid-range strategy, not overly aggressive but not purely controlling either. It will trade favorably in combat, protecting its life total while setting up its graveyard. It will try to protect its planeswalkers while setting up the graveyard, but it will not sacrifice its entire strategy to do so. It will discard bigger creatures whenever it can, and will try to use flash creatures to generate tempo, will block in combat to protect itself, and will attempt to use flash auras to get some favorable trades when needed. It will also aggressively counter removal spells to make sure its reanimation targets are protected. It will usually hold back damage spells for better targeting opportunities, but will attempt to chain them when necessary. It will try to hold land drops until main phase two, and will scry cards to find a reanimation target or a way to put something in the graveyard, surveiling cards to the top if it's about to run out of cards in library. It will try to put cards into the graveyard with Explore. It will attempt to grab better cards with Intuition and will attempt to preserve buyback spells. It will also use blink spells to reload its planeswalkers when necessary. It will generally prefer to play lands as soon as possible and will not activate Momir or Jhoira very often, preferring to set up its graveyard for its reanimation target.
