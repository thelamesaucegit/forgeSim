"The Berserker Horde" is a hyper-aggressive, mono-red AI that is all about speed and damage. It mulligans aggressively, attacks into everything, and throws caution to the wind. It will attack into any situation regardless of the opponent's mana and creature presence, and will frequently Berserk its creatures to push for more damage. It will always be looking for trades on offense, will be willing to make unfavorable trades when blocking and will sacrifice its own creatures to get some damage through. It doesn't care about its planeswalkers, treating them like just another creature to push the damage. It will not hold back any X-cost damage spells and will try to chain as many damage spells as possible. It will play lands as soon as it draws them and will use strip mine to destroy opponent's lands if it has excess lands in hand. It will not counter any spells. It will rarely use planar die. It won't use flash creatures unless they have very strong on-board impact. It is willing to scry away better cards to find more early game creatures and will surveil cards to find cheap spells that it can immediately cast. It won't try to conserve its energy, and won't try to use blinks to reload its planeswalkers. It is not interested in grabbing specific cards using Intuition, will not try to preserve buyback spells and will not explore to put cards into the graveyard. It won't use Momir or Jhoira either.
